# CS 3503 Assignment 1 - Number Base Conversion

## Author
Eden Tesfaye

## Description
My implementation of Owl Tech â€™s number base conversion utility.
Converts numbers from decimal to different bases, using a division and subtraction algorithm


## Build Instructions
 
gcc -o main main.c
main.exe
 
## Test Results
Summary: 98/100 tests passed

## Notes
I had struggles with the subtraction algorithm, due to some variables not being large enough to account for the larger tests, as well as other small logic errors.
Still not quite sure why two of the tests fail, may be an issue with the test values themselves
