# CS 3503 Assignment 2 - Data Representation and Mapping

## Author
Eden Tesfaye

## Description
Advanced data representation functions for Owl Tech ’s CPU design team .

## What ’s New
- Direct mapping functions ( oct / hex / bin )
- Signed number representations
 - Reused test framework from A1

## Build Instructions
 
gcc -o main main.c
main.exe
 
## Test Results
Summary: 49/51 tests passed

## Notes
Much easier time creating this utility than the first assignment, due to the amount of code I was able to reuse.
Many of the functions also built off of each other, which made the process quicker.
Two tests fail due to having an extra zero at the beginning, which I wasn't sure how to fix.
